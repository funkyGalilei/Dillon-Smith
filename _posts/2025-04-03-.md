<p>This one was satisfying to make, and actually didn’t take too long. I started with the idea of a yucca plant; and started looking at the Wikipedia page: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca</a> because of course. Wikipedia is awesome. Anyway, I got inspiration and chose to model a combo of some of the plants.<br></p>

<p>I started with creating a curve in the geometry node editor, knowing that I wanted to recreate a leaf with different parameters a bunch of times. It wasn’t that difficult, with 4 points being defined for each, start and end, and then the control handles given that the curve defined was a Bezier. Then, I created a profile curve and a taper curve that were inputs into Set nodes. After that, I used an array modifier to swivel and duplicate this leaf around using an empty. <br></p>

<p>The main thing I’m proud of with this creation is the floating limbs of leaves. This was done by making the end point of the curves float around, using sin waves as inputs. I first wanted to do this with real hook deform modifiers, but it didn’t end up working. Creating the inner ring of leaves was easy, I just increased the z value of the end points and end control handle, and changed some other values.<br></p>

<p>I also might make another version that visualizes the control hooks, since it looked kinda neat in the viewfinder. The other next thing to do is add a phase offset and a random noise generator, so that every leaf will operate separately. That would definitely give it a more alien quality, and make it a lot less of a swayish type of visual.<br></p>

<p>I also enjoyed modelling the flowers in this project. I just modelled one, and used a distribute in volume node to create the effect I wanted. The alpha was just slightly turned down on the flowers, and the reflectivity turned up to get the white, but almost cream effect I was looking for. Thanks, and I’ll hopefully make more iterations of this one!<br></p>
